   - Principal amount
   - Interest rate (percentage)
   - Time period (years)
2. The program calculates and displays:
   - Principal Amount
   - Interest Amount
   - Total Amount (Principal + Interest)

## Project 2: High Score Manager

### Features
- Add or update a player's high score.
- Search for a specific player's score.
- Display all scores in descending order.
- Validates inputs to ensure scores are positive integers.
- Saves scores persistently in a text file.

### How It Works
1. Users interact through a menu-based system:
   - Add/Update Score

   - Display All Scores
   - Exit
2. Scores are stored and retrieved from a text file, ensuring data is saved across sessions.
