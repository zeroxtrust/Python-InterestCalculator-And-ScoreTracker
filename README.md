## Project 2: High Score Manager

### Features
- Add or update a player's high score.
- Search for a specific player's score.

- Saves scores persistently in a text file.

### How It Works
1. Users interact through a menu-based system:

   - Display All Scores
   - Exit
2. Scores are stored and retrieved from a text file, ensuring data is saved across sessions.
